Impact on the application:

You'll need to add type definitions for all variables, function parameters, and return types.
You'll need to create interfaces or types for your MongoDB models.
Third-party libraries might require type definition files (usually installed via @types/package-name).
You'll need to update your build process to compile TypeScript to JavaScript.


-------------- backend cleanup discarded tokens often called a token blacklist

Your approach to cleaning up revoked tokens is good. When using Docker to containerize your database and backend, you have a few options for implementing the cleanup routine:

1. Within the backend container:
You can use a scheduler like node-cron within your Express application. This method keeps the cleanup process part of your main application.

import cron from 'node-cron';
import cleanupRevokedTokens from './utils/cleanupRevokedTokens';

// Run cleanup every day at midnight
cron.schedule('0 0 * * *', cleanupRevokedTokens);

2. Separate container for cleanup:
Create a separate Docker container that runs the cleanup script on a schedule. This keeps the cleanup process isolated from your main application.
Dockerfile for cleanup:
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["node", "cleanupScript.js"]
Use Docker Compose to manage both containers:
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    # ... other app configurations
  cleanup:
    build: 
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.cleanup
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    environment:
      - MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/yourdb

3. Docker Swarm or Kubernetes cron jobs:
If you're using orchestration tools, you can set up cron jobs that run in your cluster.
For Docker Swarm, you could use a service in your docker-compose.yml:
cleanup:
  image: your-cleanup-image
  deploy:
    restart_policy:
      condition: none
  command: /bin/sh -c "while true; do node cleanupScript.js; sleep 86400; done"
For Kubernetes, you'd use a CronJob resource.
4. External scheduler:
Use an external scheduling service (e.g., AWS CloudWatch Events with Lambda) to trigger the cleanup routine in your containerized application via an API endpoint.
